    - I've used **JavaScript** to add functionality to the Navigation menu.
- [**Formspree**](https://formspree.io/)
    - I've used **Formspree** to be able to receive in my email all messages submited by users throught the PortfolioÂ´s contact form.
- [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/)
    - The design tool that I've used to create the Training image (assets/images/noteBoard.jpg) and the Skills board image (assets/images/skillsBoard.jpg).

    - The design tool that I've used to create a presentation image for this project (design/responsive.png).
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
    - I've used **Git** as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Visual Studio Code, before pushing them to GitHub.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)
    - I've used **GitHub** as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

### Testing

I've mainly used Microsoft Edge's Development tools to constantly test each new piece of code to ensure its responsiveness in different size screens. I also tested my website with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

#### HTML, CSS and JavaScript Code Validation

To test this website, I used:

1. [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code. 

2. [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

3. [Code Beautyfy JavaScript Validator tool](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate) to validate my JavaScript code.

### Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my Visual Studio Code workspace.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'JS-Milestone-two'.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Visual Studio Code workspace:

```git remote add origin https://github.com/Susafp/portfolio.git```,
```git branch -M main```,
```git push -u origin main```.

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
9. Selected the 'main branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.

### Running Code Locally

To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:

1. Go to [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/Susafp/portfolio.git).
2. Click on 'Clone or download'.
3. Click on 'Download ZIP'.
4. Once downloaded, extract the zip file's contents and run my website locally.
